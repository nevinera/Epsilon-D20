Epsilon D20 is a very small rpg system.


Because of the tiny ruleset, players can be up and running in ten minutes, and you can print out the
'players guide' for each of them, on one page. 

E20 is fairly 'old school' in the sense that a great deal of the mechanics are left to DM fiat; the
Tricks system lends itself to spontaneous descriptive mechanics, and its integration into the leveling
system means that characters can become what they want to.

It hasn't yet been playtested much; I'll be trying it out on my group for the next few weeks, so
expect some rebalancing.


E20 should be a drop-in replacement for most d20 adventures (pending the rebalancing).
