Epsilon D20 is a very small rpg system.


Because of the tiny ruleset, players can be up and running in ten minutes, and you can print out the
'players guide' for each of them, on one piece of paper. 

E20 is fairly 'old school' in the sense that a great deal of the mechanics are left to DM fiat; the
Tricks system lends itself to spontaneous descriptive mechanics, and its integration into the leveling
system means that characters can become what they want to.


E20 is intended to be a drop-in replacement for d20 in most modules - specifically, it will be play-tested with (and balanced for) Paizo Adventure Path campaigns.
