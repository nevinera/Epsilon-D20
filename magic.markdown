#####Enchanting

Enchanting an item is generally done *for* a specific character.
It's 'attuned' to that user - the enchantment borrows some of the character's maxHP
(like casting a spell), and doesn't give it back until the enchantment is 'released'.
An enchantment can be released by the one it's attuned to at any time (takes a few 
minutes of concentration), and it can be de-attuned by its creator if the item is in
his possession (takes a few hours, some ritual).

Permanent enchantments are mostly a matter of legend - some royal figures claim to 
have enchanted items that require no attunement, but none of the magical academies have
managed to lay their hands on anything like that for study. Even if they are feasible,
all the legends about their creation involve the sacrifice of intelligent life, usually
in large numbers.

'Found' enchanted items are not active, but can be reactivated (and attuned) by even non-
casters; running a character's blood over them (together with an act of will), can attune
an unattuned enchantment to a character. Reattunement of an item that is still attuned probably
is not possible.

When an attunement is dropped, the HP returns after a long rest (like with casting).

The caster can always use his own HP to power an item attuned to another, but they rarely do so;
the mage can't break the attunement without having the item, so if the user runs off with it,
he's lost some of his power permanently.

Enchanting an item takes a lot of time - usually multiple days per level of enchantment,
and can easily ruin the target of the enchantment if something goes wrong.

Enchantments can be found in various spell lists, though rarely near the bottom.

Any academy or abbey that supports a sizeable contingent of casters most likely earns
its income almost entirely from the sale of enchanting services.
