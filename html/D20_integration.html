<h1>Notes on using E20 for Pathfinder/D20 campaigns</h1>

<p>This document is a work in progress; as I encounter incompatibilities between E20 and D20 modules, I'll put workarounds here.</p>

<p>As yet, I have only used E20 to finish out a D&amp;D 4e module, which required basically ad-libbing whole stat-blocks; I therefore have no useful information to relay yet.</p>
