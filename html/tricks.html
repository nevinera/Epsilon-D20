<h4>Tricks</h4>

<p>This is a short list, that will grow as we invent them.</p>

<h3>Feint:</h3>

<p><em>Pretend to hit them, then really do.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Not possible with a heavy weapon.</li>
<li><code>DEX + Subt</code> vs. <code>Reflex + N</code>, where N is the number of times Feint has been used in front of the target</li>
<li>On success, +4 to attack</li>
<li>On failure, -4 to attack</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Practiced:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Failure is -2 instead of -4, and Success gives +1 damage as well.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shield Charge:</h3>

<p><em>Move full move distance and ram your shield into someone's body.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>This is a normal attack with +3 to hit</li>
<li>Only works if you've travelled at least 10 feet</li>
<li>Deals <code>d4+STRmod</code> damage on hit</li>
<li>Roll <code>STR + Athl</code> against Reflex to knock them backwards a short distance</li>
<li>If you miss, they get an opportunity attack against you</li>
<li>Even if you hit, your AC gets a -2 penalty until your next turn</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Practiced:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>AC is only -1 till your next turn, and you get a +2 bonus on your roll to knock them back.</li>
<li>If your get a spread of 5 or more, they are knocked <em>prone</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Drive-by:</h3>

<p><em>Take a swing at a character while running past them to somewhere else.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Roll a standard attack with -1</li>
<li>If you hit, do +2 damage</li>
<li>If you miss, they can take an opportunity swing at you with -2</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Practiced:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Your attack has no penalty</li>
</ul>

<h3>Walking and Chewing Gum</h3>

<p><em>Cast a minor spell while walking normally, or slowly backward.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Cast a spell that is not of the highest rank you can cast </li>
<li>Take a penalty equal to the rank of the spell</li>
<li>If it is not an attacking spell, it loses duration or effect based on its level (ask DM)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Practiced:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Take one less penalty.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Escape Artist</h3>

<ul>
<li>Run in, attack, run out.</li>
<li>Missing with a spread of at least 5 grants the target a counterattack.</li>
<li>If the target is not aware of the attacker, spread must be at least 7.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Practiced:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Required spread increases by 1</li>
<li>If performed from behind, +1 to hit.</li>
</ul>
