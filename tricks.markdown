Tricks
----------

This is a short list, that will grow as we invent them.

###Feint:
*Pretend to hit them, then really do.*

* Not possible with a heavy weapon.
* `DEX + Subt` vs. `Reflex + N`, where N is the number of times Feint has been used in front of the target
* On success, +4 to attack
* On failure, -4 to attack

**Practiced:** 

* Failure is -2 instead of -4, and Success gives +1 damage as well.


###Shield Charge:
*Move full move distance and ram your shield into someone's body.*

* This is a normal attack with +3 to hit
* Only works if you've travelled at least 10 feet
* Deals `d4+STRmod` damage on hit
* Roll `STR + Athl` against Reflex to knock them backwards a short distance
* If you miss, they get an opportunity attack against you
* Even if you hit, your AC gets a -2 penalty until your next turn

**Practiced:**

* AC is only -1 till your next turn, and you get a +2 bonus on your roll to knock them back.
* If your get a spread of 5 or more, they are knocked *prone*.

###Drive-by:
*Take a swing at a character while running past them to somewhere else.*

* Roll a standard attack with -1
* If you hit, do +2 damage
* If you miss, they can take an opportunity swing at you with -2

**Practiced:**

* Your attack has no penalty

###Walking and Chewing Gum
*Cast a minor spell while walking normally, or slowly backward.*

* Cast a spell that is not of the highest rank you can cast 
* Take a penalty equal to the rank of the spell
* If it is not an attacking spell, it loses duration or effect based on its level (ask DM)

**Practiced:**

* Take one less penalty.
  

###Escape Artist
* Run in, attack, run out.
* Missing with a spread of at least 5 grants the target a counterattack.
* If the target is not aware of the attacker, spread must be at least 7.

**Practiced:**

* Required spread increases by 1
* If performed from behind, +1 to hit.
